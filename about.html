        <h4>About us</h4>
        <p>Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food.Humans have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric times. The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, fish, pigs and cattle. This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale with the aid of slaughterhouses.</p>
        <p>This Website is going to assist farmers and customers. <br> Those that keep large numbers of animals(farmers) are going to market their products in this site and they will have customers to come buy from them from any location.</p>
